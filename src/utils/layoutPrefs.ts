/**
 * Persisted, clamped panel sizes.
 *
 * Problem: the chat panel was drag-resizable but reset to its default on every
 *   reload (plain useState), and the chapters sidebar was not adjustable at
 *   all — while chapter summaries, which people actually read, were squeezed
 *   into it at 0.72rem.
 * Fix: one tiny helper both panels (and the overview drawer) share. Clamping
 *   on LOAD matters as much as on save: a stored size from a larger monitor,
 *   or a corrupted value, must not produce a panel wider than the window.
