 * Problem: rejecting a diff that ADDED a whole paragraph left a blank line
 * behind. The reject path only deleted the marked text range, so the `<p>`
 * wrapper the diff had introduced survived as an empty block — the document
 * never returned to its pre-diff bytes. Accepting a deletion had the mirror
 * bug: `diffHtml` drops the deleted block's tags and emits the removed text as
 * a bare `<del>`, which TipTap re-wraps in a paragraph of its own.
 *
 * Root cause: the resolution logic worked purely at text-node granularity and
 * had no notion of a block that exists *only* because of the diff.
 *
 * Fix: before collecting text ranges, find textblocks whose entire content is
 * text carrying the mark this action deletes, and remove those blocks whole —
 * expanding through ancestors (`li` inside `ul`, …) that the removal would
 * leave empty.
