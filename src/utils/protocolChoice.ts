/**
 * Which document protocol a model gets: native tool calls, or the tag markup.
 *
 * Neither wins outright — the migration to tools traded one failure for
 * another, and both halves are measured:
 *
 *  - MARKUP fails on small models. A local Qwen3-14B, asked to expand a
 *    paragraph, emitted bare <p> with no <canvas> wrapper every time, so
 *    nothing reached the document; the same request as a tool call succeeded on
 *    the first attempt. The tag protocol is a private language no model was
 *    trained on.
 *
 *  - TOOLS destroy the live preview on providers that do not stream arguments
 *    incrementally. Measured on grok, same request, same document: tool
 *    arguments arrived in ONE 113-character delta, while ordinary content
 *    arrived in 54. With a single chunk there is no intermediate state to
 *    render, so the document only changes when the turn ends.
 *
 * Hence a per-model setting rather than a global choice. 'auto' encodes the
 * measurements above so the default is right without anyone configuring
 * anything; the explicit values exist because this table describes other
 * people's streaming behaviour and will go stale — if xAI starts sending tool
 * arguments in fragments, 'tools' should become the better pick for grok
 * before this file catches up.
