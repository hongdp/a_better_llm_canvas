/**
 * Title-follows-heading, as a pure decision function.
 *
 * The editor change handler keeps a chapter's title in sync with a leading
 * <h1>. The first version synced UNCONDITIONALLY — whenever the h1 text
 * differed from the title, the title was overwritten. That made renaming a
 * chapter through the header input impossible on any document that starts
 * with an h1: the very next keystroke in the body (or LLM stream write)
 * found h1 ≠ title and reverted the rename (user-reported, 2026-08-30).
 *
 * The rule now is DIRECTIONAL: the title follows the heading only when the
 * heading itself changed in this edit. A rename through the header input
 * leaves the h1 untouched, so old-h1 === new-h1 and the rename sticks. Edit
 * the h1 later and it wins again — both rename surfaces work.
 *
 * Perf contract (do not "simplify" back to DOM parsing): this runs on every
 * editor update. Matching is a bounded regex over the first 4KB — no
 * innerHTML, which materializes <img> elements and re-decoded 200 base64
 * images per keystroke on large imports (see the original fix in App.tsx).
