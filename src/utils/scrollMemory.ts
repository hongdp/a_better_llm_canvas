/**
 * Per-chapter scroll memory.
 *
 * Problem: returning to the app threw the reader back to the top of the
 *   chapter. Two independent causes — mobile Firefox discards a backgrounded
 *   tab and reloads it on return, and the app itself used to reload the book
 *   on focus. The second is fixed at the source; the first is the browser's
 *   call, so the position has to survive a full reload.
 * Fix: remember where each chapter was scrolled to and restore it when the
 *   chapter mounts. Stored as ONE capped map so the keyspace cannot grow
 *   without bound.
