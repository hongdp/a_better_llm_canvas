/**
 * Reasoning ("thinking") effort: what the user picks, and what each provider
 * wants to hear.
 *
 * Why this exists: a reasoning model can spend minutes thinking before its
 * first visible token — measured at 127s, 187s and 199s on grok-4.6 with a
 * 42k-char prompt, all of it reasoning (8,648 chars of it in one turn). The
 * effort level is the only lever that shortens that, and every provider spells
 * it differently.
 *
 * There is no capability API to ask. xAI's /language-models returns pricing
 * and modalities and nothing about reasoning; OpenAI's and Anthropic's model
 * lists are equally silent. So the supported levels live in the table below,
 * and anything the table gets wrong shows up as the provider's own error on
 * that request.

 * and OpenAI's reasoning_effort on the o-series and gpt-5 families.
 * Anthropic and Gemini express effort as a token BUDGET rather than a word,
 * so their levels map to numbers in the request builders below.
 *
 * Probed against api.x.ai on 2026-10-05, one tiny request per level:
 * grok-4.7 and grok-4.3 accept every level, so they get grok-4.6's set.
 * grok-4.20-0309-reasoning rejects the parameter outright ("does not support
 * parameter reasoningEffort") — listing levels for it only bought a failed
 * request and a retry on every turn, so it offers 'default' alone.
 * grok-4.5 also accepted xhigh, but spent exactly the reasoning tokens of
 * high, so xhigh looks silently clamped there and stays unlisted.
