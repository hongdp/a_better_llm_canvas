# Feature Specification — Server-Side Resumable Generation

Status: **Implemented** — see §8 for what shipped and the known gaps.

## 1. Why

LLM generation used to run inside the browser tab: `services/llm.ts` streamed
straight from the provider, so anything that killed the tab killed the
generation.

**A correction to this document's original premise.** It was written expecting
that mobile Firefox discards a backgrounded tab *during* generation. Testing
on the device showed it does not: an active streaming connection keeps the tab
alive, and the discards measured earlier (JS context destroyed, `navType:
"reload"` after ~15 s in the background) happen while the tab is **idle**. The
scenario that motivated this feature therefore does not reproduce.

What the design is actually worth, all verified rather than assumed:

- **The tab is no longer a single point of failure.** Closing it, a crash, or
  an OOM kill (observed on this device during a large edit) no longer loses
  work in flight — the job keeps running on the backend.
- **Stop actually stops.** The stop button used to drop the local reader while
  the provider kept generating and billing; it now cancels the upstream
  request. The draft streamed so far stays in the document as a single undo
  step, identical on screen and in the store (Decision Log, 2026-09-05).
- **Cross-device.** A generation started on the phone can be watched on the
  desktop.

Kept deliberately after the premise was corrected: the feature is implemented,
tested and on by default when logged in, and the benefits above stand on their
own.

## 2. Shape

```
browser                     FastAPI backend                  provider
   │  POST /api/generate ────────►│
   │  ◄──── { jobId }             │──── streaming request ───►│
   │                              │◄──── deltas ──────────────│
   │  GET  …/stream?from=0 ──────►│   (buffered in the job)
   │  ◄──── replay + live SSE ────│
   │                              │
   │  (tab dies, reloads)         │   generation continues
   │  GET  /api/generate/active ─►│
   │  ◄──── [{ jobId, … }]        │
   │  GET  …/stream?from=1234 ───►│
   │  ◄──── the rest ─────────────│
```

The job keeps generating regardless of who is listening; the buffer is the
source of truth and any number of readers may attach at any offset.

## 3. HTTP contract

All endpoints require the existing session cookie; POSTs require the CSRF
header, exactly like the rest of `/api/*`.

### `POST /api/generate` → `{ "jobId": "gen-…", "createdAt": "…" }`

```jsonc
{
  "provider": "openai|gemini|anthropic|ollama|grok",
  "config": {                    // same fields the client uses today
    "apiKey": "…", "model": "…", "baseUrl": "…",
    "maxOutputTokens": 16384,
    "geminiSafetySettings": [ … ]   // gemini only
  },
  "messages": [
    { "role": "system|user|assistant", "content": "…",
      "images": ["data:image/…"],     // optional
      "cacheHint": true }             // optional, Anthropic breakpoints
  ],
  "meta": {                      // opaque to the server, echoed back
    "bookId": "…", "documentId": "…",
    "assistantMessageId": "…",
    "kind": "chat|roleplay|summary|batch"
  }
}
```

Starts streaming immediately in a background task and returns as soon as the
job is registered — the caller does not wait for the first token.

### `GET /api/generate/{jobId}/stream?from=<charOffset>` → SSE

Replays everything already buffered past `from`, then continues live:

```
data: {"type":"delta","text":"…","offset":1234}
data: {"type":"done","offset":5678,"usage":{"promptTokens":…,"completionTokens":…,"cachedPromptTokens":…}}
data: {"type":"error","message":"…","offset":1234}
```

`offset` is the buffer length after applying that event, so a reconnecting
client passes the last offset it rendered and never sees a duplicate or a
gap. Attaching to a finished job replays the whole buffer and ends with the
terminal event.

### `POST /api/generate/{jobId}/abort` → `{ "success": true }`

Cancels the provider request. The job stays readable (status `aborted`) so
clients can keep the partial text.

### `GET /api/generate/active` → job list

```jsonc
[{ "jobId": "…", "status": "running|done|error|aborted",
   "meta": { … }, "length": 1234, "createdAt": "…", "updatedAt": "…",
   "delivered": false }]
```

Used on page load to find a generation that outlived the tab. `meta` is echoed
back verbatim, which is what lets a client with no local record find the job
behind a chat bubble by `meta.assistantMessageId` (§5). `delivered` is true
once some reader has been sent the terminal event (§4).

## 4. Retention and limits

- Jobs live in memory, keyed per user. A finished job whose result **reached a
  reader** is kept **10 minutes**, so a reload right after completion still
  gets it. One that finished with **nobody reading** (phone locked, tab
  discarded, laptop closed) is kept **24 hours**: until someone receives the
  terminal event, the reply exists nowhere else. A user Stop counts as
  delivered — that result was discarded on purpose.
- At most **20 jobs per user**; delivered results are evicted first, then the
  oldest unread one, and a running job is never evicted. The cap counts jobs,
  so the longer unread window does not raise the memory bound.
- Buffer cap **4 MB** per job; past that the job keeps streaming to
  subscribers but stops growing the buffer and marks `truncatedBuffer: true`
  (a whole-book batch answer is far below this).
- A server restart drops in-flight jobs. That is accepted for v1: the client
  keeps its own partial text (§5) so nothing the user could already see is
  lost.

## 5. Client

`streamLLM(messages, config, callbacks)` keeps its signature — every caller
(`useChatLLM`, `useRoleplayLLM`, chapter summaries, whole-book batches) is
unchanged. Internally it picks a transport:

- **remote** (default when logged in): POST the job, persist
  `{ jobId, meta, offset }` to localStorage, attach to the SSE stream, and
  map events onto the existing `onChunk` / `onDone` / `onError` callbacks.
  The persisted offset advances as chunks are rendered.
- **direct** (not logged in, or the remote start fails): today's code path,
  untouched, so the app still works fully offline from the backend.

Rejoin on load, in two steps:

1. **The local record, as a fast path.** If localStorage names a job the server
   still has — running *or finished* — the client re-attaches and streams into
   the same assistant message. The record is cleared by the terminal event,
   before the completion path runs, so a record that survived proves the turn
   was never completed here, even if every character had been rendered.
2. **The server, as the source of truth.** With no usable record, the client
   looks for assistant bubbles that never received a reply (the placeholder, or
   a notice written in its place) and asks `/api/generate/active` for a job
   whose `meta.assistantMessageId` matches. A match is rejoined exactly like
   (1) and gets a local record of its own; a bubble with no job anywhere is
   retired with an "Interrupted" notice. If the server **cannot be asked**,
   nothing is touched — "could not ask" is never read as "no job". No
   unfinished bubble means no request at all.

The record is one localStorage slot on one origin, so it is a hint only: a turn
sent from another device, or over the LAN address instead of localhost, or
followed by any other generation, has none.

The rejoin watchdog (20 s) bounds how long it takes to **attach** — to receive
any frame, the server's immediate `attached` included. It says nothing about
the model, whose first token can be minutes away. If it does fire, the bubble
says the reconnect failed and the record is kept for the next load; it is never
reported as a user stop.

Abort: the stop button calls the abort endpoint as well as dropping the
reader, so stopping on one device stops the actual generation.

## 6. Security notes

Provider API keys already reach this backend (they are part of the synced
`providerConfigs` settings blob), and the backend is the user's own machine
behind their own auth. The job endpoints add no new exposure class, but two
rules hold: keys are never logged (the existing masking helper applies), and
jobs are strictly scoped to the creating username — a job id from another
user's session must 404, not leak.

## 7. Testing

- **pytest**: job registry lifecycle (create → buffer → done), replay from an
  offset (no duplicates, no gaps), abort, retention/eviction, per-user
  isolation (another user's job id 404s), and provider request building for
  all five providers with a stubbed HTTP layer.
- **vitest**: the remote transport maps SSE events onto the callback
  contract; a reconnect resumes from the stored offset; a failed remote start
  falls back to the direct path; abort calls the endpoint.
- **End-to-end**: a stub provider served locally, driven through the real
  backend, verifying that killing and re-attaching a reader loses nothing.

## 8. Implementation notes

Shipped as specified, with these deliberate decisions and known gaps:

- **The `done` event doubles as the abort terminal.** An aborted job ends
  with `{"type":"done","status":"aborted",…}` rather than an error, so the
  partial text is delivered through the normal completion path instead of
  being reported as a failure.
- **Rejoin re-attaches at offset 0, not the persisted offset.** The render
  path parses the response as a whole — a `<canvas>` tag opened before the
  offset must be seen — and a reload destroys the accumulated raw text.
  Replay is safe because each chunk re-renders the bubble from the
  accumulator rather than appending. The persisted offset still decides
  whether a job is worth rejoining, and the transport supports arbitrary
  offsets.
- **Rejoin waits for the assistant message to exist.** Chat history is
  restored by the background server sync *after* mount, so the rejoin polls
  (bounded, 15 s) for `meta.assistantMessageId` before streaming into it.
- **Only the START of a remote job falls back to the direct transport.**
  Once a job exists, failures are reported through `onError`; falling back
  later would run the same generation twice.
- **One SSE parser.** The line-splitting loop was lifted out of
  `readSSEStream` into `readSSEDataLines`, shared by the direct and remote
  paths.
- **Buffer cap counts CHARACTERS**, matching the character offsets in the
  event contract; a byte cap would make the offset semantics ambiguous.
- **Reliability pass, 2026-09-20.** Found from one live turn (grok, 230 s to
  first token) that was reloaded while the model was still reasoning. The
  rejoin attached, received only `attached` and `reasoning` frames, and was
  aborted by a watchdog that counted `onChunk`/`onDone`/`onError` alone; the
  abort reached the normal error path as an `AbortError`, so the bubble read
  "Stopped." for a job nobody stopped, which went on to finish with no reader
  left. Fixed together with what the same investigation turned up: bubbles
  retired on the absence of a *local* record (§5 step 2), a failed lookup read
  as "no job", a finished-and-fully-rendered job forgotten although its
  completion never ran, a connection that died by *throwing* getting no
  re-attach while one that died by *ending* did (a refused stream — 404 — is
  still not retried), and unread results expiring after ten minutes (§4).
- **Gap — no stall detection.** The server sends a keep-alive comment every
  15 s, but the client does not watch for its absence, so a connection that
  goes silent without closing leaves the reader waiting until the page is
  reloaded (which then rejoins). Not observed in practice yet.
- **Gap — roleplay cannot rejoin.** Its stop button now aborts the
  server-side job, but roleplay sends no `remoteMeta`, so a roleplay
  generation that outlives its tab completes on the server without the UI
  re-attaching. Its render path differs enough to warrant its own pass.
- **Gap — a server restart drops in-flight jobs** (§4), by design for v1.
